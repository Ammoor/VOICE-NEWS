          Why the US has the most pro-Israel foreign policy in the world?

          Everyone knows the United States is Israel's best friend. The US gives
          Israel billions of dollars in aid annually, consistently blocks UN
          Security Council resolutions condemning Israel, and backs its military
          offensives publicly. But why? What's the thinking behind America going
          above-and-beyond for Israel? <br /><br />The short version: it's
          complicated. The long version is that It's a tight interplay of
          America's long-running Middle East strategy, US public
          opinion/electoral politics, and a pro-Israel lobbying campaign that is
          effective, but maybe not as effective as you've heard. Here's a guide
          to the different factors shaping America's Israel policy â€” and how
          they relate to each other.

        <div class="sub-articles">
          The US wasn't always so close with Israel. For instance, when Israel
          (along with France and Britain) invaded Egypt in 1956, the United
          States sided against Israel, pushing the invaders to leave. And the US
          for years opposed, and worked actively against, Israel's clandestine
          nuclear program. "Stated commitments to [Israel from American
          policymakers] cannot erase a legacy of US policies that often
          represented more of a threat than a support to Israeli security,"
          Michael Barnett, George Washington University political scientist,
          writes. <br /><br />Even when the US did come to support Israel, it
          was more about cold strategic calculation than the domestic political
          support you see today. The US-Israel relationship grew "by leaps and
          bounds" after 1967, according to Barnett, owing largely to "a changing
          US containment and strategic posture." American presidents and
          strategists came to see Israel as a useful tool for containing Soviet
          influence in the Middle East, which was significant among Arab states,
          and used diplomatic and military support to weave Israel firmly into
          the anti-Soviet bloc. <br /><br />This strategic justification came
          down with the Berlin Wall. Yet the US aid to Israel kept flowing after
          the Cold War, as did diplomatic support. What kept it going?
          <br /><br />For one thing, the US approach to the Middle East didn't
          change that much after the Cold War. The US became increasingly
          involved in managing disputes and problems inside the Middle East
          during the Cold War, and it maintained that role as the world's sole
          super-power in the 90s. Stability in the Middle East continued to be a
          major American interest, for a number of reasons that included the
          global oil market, and the US took on the role as guarantor of
          regional stability. <br /><br />That meant the US saw it as
          strategically worthwhile to support states like Egypt, Saudi Arabia,
          and Israel, which saw themselves as benefitting from an essentially
          conservative US approach to Middle Eastern regional politics. Unlike,
          say, Iran, Syria, and Saddam's Iraq, these countries were basically OK
          with the status quo in the Middle East. The US also supported the
          status quo, so it supported them accordingly. <br /><br />This view of
          Israel as a "force for stability" helps maintain US support, according
          to Brent Sasley, a political scientist at the University of Texas, "in
          the sense that Israel can stabilize what's going on in the Middle
          East. If there's fear of Jordan being undermined by an internal or
          external enemy, the United States sometimes turns to Israel to pose a
          threat to that threat." <br /><br />America's self-appointed role as
          manager of the Middle East also landed it the job of
          Israeli-Palestinian peace broker. <br /><br />"The parties need a
          third party," Hussein Ibish, a Senior Fellow at the American Task
          Force on Palestine, says. "I think there is no other candidate than
          the United States. There's no other party that's capable, and no other
          party that's interested." <br /><br />American policymakers have seen
          US support for Israel as a way of showing Israel that the US is still
          taking its interests into account during negotiations, and thus
          convincing Israel that they can safely engage in peace talks. It's
          meant to draw the Israelis to the negotiating table, and keep them
          there. <br /><br />Together, these strategic factors explain why
          America's approach to Israel has been broadly consistent for at least
          the past three administrations. Despite the vast disagreements between
          the George W. Bush administration versus the Clinton and Obama
          administrations on foreign policy, they've both supported military and
          political aid to Israel. And they've both crossed Israel when it
          wasn't in the US' strategic interests: Bush refused to support an
          Israeli strike on Iran, and Obama repeatedly clashed with Israeli
          leaders on West Bank settlements. <br /><br />All of this isn't to say
          that American presidents and foreign policy principals are necessarily
          right to believe these things. It's within the realm of possibility,
          as some argue, that US support for Israel undermines regional
          stability and compromises America's status as neutral broker during
          peace negotiations. The point here isn't to endorse the official US
          view, but describe the line of thinking that's been so influential in
          driving the American foreign policy establishment's approach to
          Israel.

          Supporting Israel is good politics in the US

        <div class="sub-articles">
          US support for Israel isn't just about strategic calculation and
          foreign policy interests, or at least not anymore. For a long time, at
          the very least since the 1980s, it's also been about domestic politics
          and the way American politicians read American voters.
          <br /><br />Congressional votes on issues relating to Israel are
          famously lopsided. The Senate resolution supporting Israel's recent
          offensives in Gaza passed unanimously, as many "pro-Israel" bills and
          resolutions do. <br /><br />The simplest explanation for these
          lopsided votes is that supporting Israel is really, really popular
          among voters. "The single factor most driving the U.S.-Israel
          relationship appears to be the broad and deep support for Israel among
          the American public," Israel Institute program director Michael Koplow
          writes. "The average gap between those holding favorable and
          unfavorable views of Israel over [the past four administrations] is 31
          points." <br /><br />Indeed, Gallup data since 1988 consistently shows
          a much higher percentage of Americans sympathizing with Israelis than
          with Palestinians in the conflict:
        </div>
        <div class="images">

        <div class="sub-articles">
          So it makes sense that Congresspeople would take pretty hard-core
          pro-Israel stances: it's reasonably popular. <br /><br />But why is
          Israel so popular among Americans in the first place? One big reason
          is a perceived sense of "shared values." According to Barnett, the
          American moral image of Israel â€” "the only democracy in the Middle
          East," for example â€” is the "foundation of US-Israeli relations." Of
          course, as Barnett hastens to add, this leaves Israel vulnerable if
          Americans comes to believe that Israel has strayed from those shared
          values (more on that in the last section). <br /><br />Religious
          groups are two other critically important factors. American Jews and
          evangelical Christians are two of the most politically engaged groups
          in the United States. They're major constituencies, respectively, in
          the Democratic and Republican parties. And both are overwhelmingly
          pro-Israel. <br /><br />There are nuances here: evangelical support
          for Israel tends to be more uncritical than Jewish support. For
          instance, a majority of reform and secular Jews â€” 65 percent of the
          American Jewish population â€” disapprove of Israel's expansion of West
          Bank settlements. And Jews under the age of 35 are the least likely to
          identify as Zionist (though a majority still do). On the other hand,
          the older and more conservative Jews who aren't entirely
          representative of the more liberal body of Jewish-American public
          opinion toward Israel, have a lot of clout with national politicians.
          They express strong desire to vote based on the Israel issue and are
          clustered in Florida and Pennsylvania, large swing states in
          presidential elections. <br /><br />All that said, Pew data shows
          overall consistency in American Jewish views on the US-Israel
          relationship. 54 percent of American Jews think the US supports Israel
          the right amount â€” and 31 percent say it doesn't go far enough. By
          contrast, 31 percent of white evangelicals think the US has reached
          the right level of support, while 46 percent want the US to support
          Israel more. <br /><br />Add evangelicals, Jews, and broad public
          support together, and you get consistent, bipartisan support for
          Israel.

        <div class="sub-articles">
          No account of US-Israel relations can ignore the American Israel
          Public Affairs Committee â€” AIPAC for short. AIPAC is America's largest
          pro-Israel lobby. Surveys of Capitol Hill insiders conducted by
          Fortune (1997) and National Journal (2005) ranked it the second-most
          powerful lobbying shop in Washington, after (respectively) the AARP
          and National Federation of Independent Business. Neither survey is
          particularly statistically rigorous, so don't take the specific
          rankings too seriously. And AIPAC loses on plenty of issues. However,
          the surveys do suggest that AIPAC is perceived as hugely powerful
          within Washington.
          <br /><br />Saying that AIPAC pushes US foreign policy in a more
          pro-Israel direction isn't controversial. The big, and extremely
          contentious, question is just how much AIPAC actually matters. Is the
          group actually steering US politics and foreign policy in a direction
          it wouldn't go on its own? <br /><br />The major flashpoint here is
          John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt's The Israel Lobby and American
          Foreign Policy, which began as an 2006 essay and evolved into a book.
          The two eminent international relations scholars argued that there's
          no way to explain the US-Israel relationship, from an IR perspective,
          other than as AIPAC and its allies pushing the US to act counter to
          its own interests. They reject that either strategy or shared values
          fully explain the US support for Israel, so lobbying must. "The
          unmatched power of the Israel Lobby," Walt and Mearsheimer write, is
          "the" explanation for America's continued strong support for Israel.
          <br /><br />This argument is hugely controversial, including among
          international relations theorists. Some argued that The Israel Lobby
          creepily invoked classic anti-Semitic tropes of Jews secretly
          controlling the government. Others dismissed it as, in one
          particularly memorable phrase, "piss-poor, monocausal social science."
          <br /><br />One of the main criticisms of Walt and Mearsheimer's
          thesis is that they don't present very much direct evidence that AIPAC
          lobbying influenced specific votes. Another criticism is that Walt and
          Mearsheimer premise their thesis on the argument that Israel is
          neither strategically nor morally worthy of American support, and so
          policymakers must be supporting Israel because they've been coerced
          into it by AIPAC, whereas a number of policymakers will tell you they
          earnestly believe the alliance is worthwhile absent lobbying. Critics
          also argue that the definition of "Israel Lobby" beyond AIPAC used in
          the book is so large as to encompass basically the entire American
          foreign policy establishment. <br /><br />Whatever you think of this
          debate, it can be easy to get lost in a binary between "the Israel
          lobby is all that matters" and "the Israel lobby is irrelevant."
          What's clearly true is that AIPAC is highly influential, but also that
          its power is linked to the other sources of US support for Israel; it
          does well on whipping up support for bills that are already in line
          with public opinion. <br /><br />AIPAC doesn't always win. For
          instance, it lost a major fight in Congress when it pushed for more
          sanctions on Iran in February 2014; the sanctions were likely designed
          to kill the ongoing US-Iran nuclear negotiations. AIPAC's influence is
          a product of financial resources and power, sure, but also of choosing
          to push for policies that have public support and are consonant with
          American grand strategy in the Middle East.

        <div class="sub-articles">
          It's hard to know where one driver of America's Israel policy ends and
          another begins. For instance: early in his administration, President
          Obama pushed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to halt
          settlement growth in the West Bank; Netanyahu resisted this in part by
          rallying his allies in Congress. Netanyahu's allies in both parties,
          who are always eager to appear pro-Israel, pressured Obama to drop his
          anti-settlements push, which he did. <br /><br />The question here is
          whether, in this case and others, US foreign policy interests or US
          domestic politics was ultimately more consequential to driving the
          US-Israel relationship. For example, would Obama have pushed harder
          against settlements had Netanyahu not been able to call up so many
          allies in Congress? Were those members of Congress primarily driven by
          pure domestic politics, which do favor pro-Israel policies, by an
          earnest concern that Obama's approach was bad for Israelis, or by a
          belief that Obama was hurting US foreign policy interests?
          <br /><br />In thinking about the future of US-Israel relations, it's
          much more helpful to examine what might cause these broad-bush factors
          to change. In simpler terms: is there a scenario under which the US
          and Israel drift apart? <br /><br />Barnett, the George Washington
          University scholar, sees Israel's continued occupation of the West
          Bank as the greatest threat to the relationship. He notes that, in the
          early '90s, Congress made a $10 billion loan guarantee conditional on
          the fact that Israel didn't use any of the money for West Bank
          settlements. Israel's prime minister, Yitzhak Shamir, tried to fight
          it, but the Bush administration stood firm. Shamir lost, both in
          Congress and with the executive, because the Israeli position wasn't
          consistent with the US vision of a Western, democratic Israel.
          <br /><br />"US-Israeli relations," Barnett writes, "are dependent
          upon Israel's having a particular identity." That may even be true
          among American Jews, as journalist Peter Beinart argued in an essay
          almost as controversial as Walt and Mearsheimer's. Beinart argues that
          Israel's ongoing occupation of the West Bank is already alienating
          younger and more secular Jews, and that AIPAC and other mainstream
          Jewish organizations risk losing their broad base of support unless
          they become more willing to criticize Israel on these points.
          <br /><br />Barnett's conclusion only follows if you think "shared
          values" are the linchpin of US-Israel relations. Maybe the US would
          still think it's strategically useful to support Israel. Maybe Israel
          remains popular among certain Christians and the broader public
          regardless of its Palestinian policy. Maybe AIPAC remains strong
          enough to keep Congress in line. Maybe Israel comes to an agreement
          with the Palestinians and Barnett's point becomes moot.
          <br /><br />For now, though, there's little evidence that American
          support for Israel is fundamentally breaking down â€” whether you think
          that's a good or bad thing.
