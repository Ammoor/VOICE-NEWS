        <h2 class="titles-of-sub-articles">What is Hamas?</h2>
        <div class="sub-articles">
          Hamas is an Palestinian resistance organization that controls the Gaza
          Strip. Hamas’ 1988 charter states: “Hamas rejects any alternative to
          the full and complete liberation of Palestine, from the river to the
          sea” — i.e., the annihilation of Israel. The charter says: “The Day of
          Judgment will not come about until Muslims fight Jews and kill them.”
          <br /><br />Hamas later issued a new policy document, which did not
          replace or supersede its original charter, that included more coded
          language with calls for “resisting the occupation with all means and
          methods.” <br /><br />Since conquering the Gaza Strip by force in
          2007, Hamas has maintained a standing army of fighters and an arsenal
          of light arms, mortars, rockets, shoulder-fired anti-aircraft
          missiles, drones, and more.
        </div>
        <h2 class="titles-of-sub-articles">Why does Hamas control Gaza?</h2>
        <div class="sub-articles">
          Israel took control of the Gaza Strip after the Six-Day War in 1967.
          In 2005, under U.S. pressure, then Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon
          unilaterally withdrew from the coastal enclave, removing every Israeli
          town, including every citizen, soldier, and grave. <br /><br />The
          Palestinian Authority (PA) ruled Gaza for two years, until 2007, but
          because of some disagreements between the Palestinian Authority and
          Hamas leaders, The Palestinian Authority (PA) decided to be content
          with ruling the West Bank and leaving Gaza under control of Hamas
          leaders.
        </div>
        <h2 class="titles-of-sub-articles">
          Is Hamas a designated terrorist entity?
        </h2>
        <div class="sub-articles">
          The United States designated Hamas as a Foreign Terrorist Organization
          in 1997, freezing its U.S.-based assets, barring members from entering
          the country, and banning the provision of “material support or
          resources.” <br /><br />The U.S. government subsequently sanctioned
          Hamas-related charities and senior Hamas members and blocked funds
          related to Hamas activity. Israel, the United Kingdom, Canada,
          Australia, New Zealand, and 15 European states have also sanctioned
          some or all of Hamas.

        <div class="sub-articles">
          ANKARA, Oct 25 - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, in his strongest
          comments yet on the Gaza conflict, said on Wednesday the Palestinian
          militant group Hamas was not a terrorist organisation but a liberation
          group fighting to protect Palestinian lands. <br /><br />"Hamas is not
          a terrorist organisation, it is a liberation group, 'mujahideen'
          waging a battle to protect its lands and people," he told lawmakers
          from his ruling AK Party, using an Arabic word denoting those who
          fight for their faith. <br /><br />Unlike many of its NATO allies and
          the European Union, Turkey does not consider Hamas a terrorist
          organisation and hosts members of the group on its territory. Ankara
          backs a two-state solution to the decades-old Israel-Palestinian
          conflict. <br /><br />Erdogan also slammed Western powers for
          supporting Israel's bombing of Gaza and called for an immediate
          ceasefire, the unhindered entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza and for
          Muslim countries to work together to stop the violence.
          <br /><br />"The perpetrators of the massacre and the destruction
          taking place in Gaza are those providing unlimited support for
          Israel," Erdogan said. "Israel's attacks on Gaza, for both itself and
          those supporting them, amount to murder and mental illness."

        <div class="sub-articles">
          When the Israeli prisoners were released as part of the exchange deal
          between the occupation and the Palestinian resistance factions, their
          relatives revealed positive details regarding the conditions of their
          detention in the Gaza Strip. However, in light of the media blackout
          imposed on the events, the Israeli “Walla” website revealed a report
          presenting testimonies from Prisoners' families. <br /><br />After
          meeting the 13 prisoners who were released, a relative quoted one of
          the prisoners about his period of detention in Gaza, saying: “At first
          they were not with many people, and at some point more were added to
          them. They had radio and television there, and they could hear... News
          from Israel. <br /><br />“They did not go through anything unpleasant,
          they were treated humanely, and there were no horror stories that we
          thought there were,” a relative confirmed, citing another released
          elderly prisoner. <br /><br />Professor Gilat Livni, Director of the
          Department of Returned Children at Schneider Hospital, said: "The
          released abductees talked about the 'experiences' they went through."
          We don't ask many questions, but they: "They tell stories and we
          listen to them, and sometimes we cry with them, but I can't share the
          stories." <br /><br />Tel Aviv asked all released Israeli prisoners
          not to speak to the media, after two female prisoners who were
          released several weeks ago revealed that they had been treated
          humanely, which belies the occupation’s narrative that describes
          resistance fighters and the people of Gaza as “human animals.”
          <br /><br />The Israeli settler, Yocheved Lifshitz, who was released
          by the Al-Qassam Brigades, on October 23, reported how resistance
          members treated her during her detention period inside the Gaza Strip,
          and confirmed that she was not subjected to abuse.
          <br /><br />Lifshitz said: “Hamas treated us with kindness, met all
          our needs, and I underwent a medical examination during my detention,”
          adding that the Al-Qassam members “assured me that they were Muslims,
          and would not harm us, and we ate the same food as them,” as she put
          it.

          The Israeli Broadcasting Corporation said that Tel Aviv "received a
          list of names of the second batch of prisoners to be released, from
          among those detained in the Gaza Strip." <br /><br />In turn, the
          Hebrew Channel 12 reported that 13 Israeli prisoners, including women
          and children, are scheduled to be released. <br /><br />The first
          temporary humanitarian truce for 4 days between Israel and the
          Palestinian factions entered into force, since the outbreak of the
          bloody aggression launched by Israel against the Gaza Strip since last
          October 7. <br /><br />The temporary humanitarian truce agreement
          includes the release of 50 Israeli prisoners from Gaza in exchange for
          the release of 150 Palestinians from Israeli prisons, and the entry of
          hundreds of trucks loaded with humanitarian, relief, medical and fuel
          aid to all areas of the Strip.

          In the end, there is a big difference between the owner of the land
          and the usurper of that land, between the owner of the right and the
          owner of wrongdoing, between those who have morals and those who have
          no morals. <br /><br />Hamas was not created to harm innocents and
          civilians, but to resist the violations of this occupier against the
          landowners.
