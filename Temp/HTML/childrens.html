          Gaza conflict: how children’s lives are affected on every level

        <div class="sub-articles">
          Gaza has been under blockade for 16 years so children have grown up
          facing deprivation and conflict. <br /><br />
          Children living in Gaza have never known anything but overcrowding,
          shortages, conflict and danger. <br /><br />It’s been 18 years since
          the then Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, moved all Israel’s
          settlers and military personnel out of the Gaza Strip. The country’s
          official narrative then became that they were no longer an occupying
          force. <br /><br />But two years later, following the election of
          Hamas, the Israeli government imposed a blockade on the entire Gaza
          Strip. So today’s 18-year-olds have suffered in a state of privation
          for pretty much their whole lives. <br /><br />Relocation of settlers
          and soldiers and the imposition of the blockade did not release Israel
          from its responsibility under international law towards the civilian
          population in Gaza. According to the International Committee of the
          Red Cross, Israel is still “bound by certain obligations under the law
          of occupation”. As detailed in article 55 of the fourth Geneva
          convention, this includes ensuring that the population of Gaza
          receives food, medicines and other basic goods. <br /><br />
          But over recent days the Israeli government has tightened the blockade
          so that even commodities essential for survival are denied to the
          civilian population. As researchers on the protection of children in
          Gaza, we – the authors of this article – are receiving messages from
          families that they are surviving on bread and contaminated water.
          <br /><br />The world is learning, almost in real time, about the
          impact on the children of Gaza of the latest siege-like conditions
          imposed by Israel in the wake of Hamas’ attacks. The lack of water and
          food is inevitably affecting the young more immediately and more
          severely than adults. <br /><br />Those children who fall sick or are
          injured seek treatment in a collapsing health system, with multiple
          facilities attacked. Those still functioning must manage an impossible
          level of demand along with a drastic shortage of medicine. In such
          circumstances many children are vulnerable to severe harm and death.

        <h2 class="titles-of-sub-articles">The toll of war</h2>
        <div class="sub-articles">
          But it would be a mistake to assume that even prior to the current
          tightening of the blockade, children in Gaza enjoyed healthy lives.
          Within the densely populated Gaza Strip, the health needs of children
          have grown exponentially due to the conditions of the Israeli
          blockade.
          <br /><br />
          Regular exposure to direct military attacks affects both the physical
          and mental health of the young. Older children will have experienced
          six wars including the current one in their brief lifetimes (2008-9,
          2012, 2014, 2021, 2022 and 2023). <br /><br />Since Israel imposed its
          blockade in 2007 up until the current war, Defense for Children
          International - Palestine (DCIP), a Palestinian human rights
          organisation specifically focused on child rights, has counted 1,189
          Palestinian children killed in Gaza by Israeli military attacks. These
          wars have also created long-term threats to children’s survival and
          wellbeing. In the aftermath of each war, Israel has tightened access
          to Gaza via the main commercial crossing for construction materials,
          generators and water.

          Without these materials, it has been impossible to clear the debris
          fully, and to rebuild homes, schools, hospitals and public spaces. The
          lack of reconstruction poses severe risks to children playing outside.
          <br /><br />A report conducted by the UN Environment Programme
          following the 2008-9 war highlighted the serious health issues due to
          the debris that would particularly affect children. Polluted water
          supplies, contaminated soil, extensive rubble, including exposed metal
          rods, have all created grave risk for the young.

        <h2 class="titles-of-sub-articles">Crumbling infrastructure</h2>
        <div class="sub-articles">
          Blockade has also made it impossible to develop vitally needed
          infrastructure. The provision of clean water and adequate sewage and
          waste disposal requires massive investment to meet the needs of the
          population. Meanwhile, the electricity shortages and shortage of
          sanitation structures mean that the sea in Gaza is highly contaminated
          by sewage and poorly treated wastewater. <br /><br />With very few
          safe public play spaces for children, the beach is one place that many
          have turned to for relief. According to a 2018 report by the RAND
          Corporation, however, water-related diseases are a primary cause of
          child and infant mortality in Gaza. <br /><br />Some children require
          complex medical care that is not available in Gaza. Under
          international law, children’s access to adequate medical care is the
          responsibility of Israel. According to human rights organisations,
          requests for medical permits for children to access necessary care in
          Israel are routinely denied. <br /><br />The need for rehabilitative
          support for disabled children grew in 2018 and 2019 when thousands of
          children and youth participated in demonstrations during the “great
          march of return”. Israeli forces responded with live and rubber
          bullets, killing 46 and injuring nearly 8,800 children. Many children
          who sustained life-altering injuries, including loss of limbs, were
          not granted permits to leave Gaza to receive the rehabilitative care
          they required.

          Palestinian doctors, nurses, other medical practitioners, social
          workers and civil society organisations have spent 16 years doing
          their utmost to provide for the health and wellbeing of Palestinian
          children in Gaza under blockade. <br /><br />Despite multiple
          evacuation orders from the Israeli military in the past week, hospital
          staff continue to work around the clock to save lives. Yet health
          workers and facilities are under attack. Meanwhile DCIP is reporting
          that in the past week more than 1,000 Palestinian children have been
          killed. <br /><br />It must be understood that Israel’s actions in the
          last week –- termed as “ethnic cleansing” by UN human rights officials
          –- are an extension of 16 years of killing both children’s bodies and
          their hopes through its blockade.
