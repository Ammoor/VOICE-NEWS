        Everyone knows the United States is Israel's best friend. The US gives
        Israel billions of dollars in aid annually, consistently blocks UN
        Security Council resolutions condemning Israel, and backs its military
        offensives publicly. But why? What's the thinking behind America going
        above-and-beyond for Israel? <br /><br />The short version: it's
        complicated. The long version is that It's a tight interplay of
        America's long-running Middle East strategy, US public opinion/electoral
        politics, and a pro-Israel lobbying campaign that is effective, but
        maybe not as effective as you've heard. Here's a guide to the different
        factors shaping America's Israel policy — and how they relate to each
        other. <br /><br />

        The US wasn't always so close with Israel. For instance, when Israel
        (along with France and Britain) invaded Egypt in 1956, the United States
        sided against Israel, pushing the invaders to leave. And the US for
        years opposed, and worked actively against, Israel's clandestine nuclear
        program. "Stated commitments to [Israel from American policymakers]
        cannot erase a legacy of US policies that often represented more of a
        threat than a support to Israeli security," Michael Barnett, George
        Washington University political scientist, writes. <br /><br />Even when
        the US did come to support Israel, it was more about cold strategic
        calculation than the domestic political support you see today. The
        US-Israel relationship grew "by leaps and bounds" after 1967, according
        to Barnett, owing largely to "a changing US containment and strategic
        posture." American presidents and strategists came to see Israel as a
        useful tool for containing Soviet influence in the Middle East, which
        was significant among Arab states, and used diplomatic and military
        support to weave Israel firmly into the anti-Soviet bloc.
        <br /><br />This strategic justification came down with the Berlin Wall.
        Yet the US aid to Israel kept flowing after the Cold War, as did
        diplomatic support. What kept it going? <br /><br />For one thing, the
        US approach to the Middle East didn't change that much after the Cold
        War. The US became increasingly involved in managing disputes and
        problems inside the Middle East during the Cold War, and it maintained
        that role as the world's sole super-power in the 90s. Stability in the
        Middle East continued to be a major American interest, for a number of
        reasons that included the global oil market, and the US took on the role
        as guarantor of regional stability. <br /><br />That meant the US saw it
        as strategically worthwhile to support states like Egypt, Saudi Arabia,
        and Israel, which saw themselves as benefitting from an essentially
        conservative US approach to Middle Eastern regional politics. Unlike,
        say, Iran, Syria, and Saddam's Iraq, these countries were basically OK
        with the status quo in the Middle East. The US also supported the status
        quo, so it supported them accordingly. <br /><br />This view of Israel
        as a "force for stability" helps maintain US support, according to Brent
        Sasley, a political scientist at the University of Texas, "in the sense
        that Israel can stabilize what's going on in the Middle East. If there's
        fear of Jordan being undermined by an internal or external enemy, the
        United States sometimes turns to Israel to pose a threat to that
        threat." <br /><br />America's self-appointed role as manager of the
        Middle East also landed it the job of Israeli-Palestinian peace broker.
        <br /><br />"The parties need a third party," Hussein Ibish, a Senior
        Fellow at the American Task Force on Palestine, says. "I think there is
        no other candidate than the United States. There's no other party that's
        capable, and no other party that's interested." <br /><br />American
        policymakers have seen US support for Israel as a way of showing Israel
        that the US is still taking its interests into account during
        negotiations, and thus convincing Israel that they can safely engage in
        peace talks. It's meant to draw the Israelis to the negotiating table,
        and keep them there. <br /><br />Together, these strategic factors
        explain why America's approach to Israel has been broadly consistent for
        at least the past three administrations. Despite the vast disagreements
        between the George W. Bush administration versus the Clinton and Obama
        administrations on foreign policy, they've both supported military and
        political aid to Israel. And they've both crossed Israel when it wasn't
        in the US' strategic interests: Bush refused to support an Israeli
        strike on Iran, and Obama repeatedly clashed with Israeli leaders on
        West Bank settlements. <br /><br />All of this isn't to say that
        American presidents and foreign policy principals are necessarily right
        to believe these things. It's within the realm of possibility, as some
        argue, that US support for Israel undermines regional stability and
        compromises America's status as neutral broker during peace
        negotiations. The point here isn't to endorse the official US view, but
        describe the line of thinking that's been so influential in driving the
        American foreign policy establishment's approach to Israel. <br /><br />

        US support for Israel isn't just about strategic calculation and foreign
        policy interests, or at least not anymore. For a long time, at the very
        least since the 1980s, it's also been about domestic politics and the
        way American politicians read American voters. <br /><br />Congressional
        votes on issues relating to Israel are famously lopsided. The Senate
        resolution supporting Israel's recent offensives in Gaza passed
        unanimously, as many "pro-Israel" bills and resolutions do.
        <br /><br />The simplest explanation for these lopsided votes is that
        supporting Israel is really, really popular among voters. "The single
        factor most driving the U.S.-Israel relationship appears to be the broad
        and deep support for Israel among the American public," Israel Institute
        program director Michael Koplow writes. "The average gap between those
        holding favorable and unfavorable views of Israel over [the past four
        administrations] is 31 points." <br /><br />Indeed, Gallup data since
        1988 consistently shows a much higher percentage of Americans
        sympathizing with Israelis than with Palestinians in the conflict:

        So it makes sense that Congresspeople would take pretty hard-core
        pro-Israel stances: it's reasonably popular. <br /><br />But why is
        Israel so popular among Americans in the first place? One big reason is
        a perceived sense of "shared values." According to Barnett, the American
        moral image of Israel — "the only democracy in the Middle East," for
        example — is the "foundation of US-Israeli relations." Of course, as
        Barnett hastens to add, this leaves Israel vulnerable if Americans comes
        to believe that Israel has strayed from those shared values (more on
        that in the last section). <br /><br />Religious groups are two other
        critically important factors. American Jews and evangelical Christians
        are two of the most politically engaged groups in the United States.
        They're major constituencies, respectively, in the Democratic and
        Republican parties. And both are overwhelmingly pro-Israel.
        <br /><br />There are nuances here: evangelical support for Israel tends
        to be more uncritical than Jewish support. For instance, a majority of
        reform and secular Jews — 65 percent of the American Jewish population —
        disapprove of Israel's expansion of West Bank settlements. And Jews
        under the age of 35 are the least likely to identify as Zionist (though
        a majority still do). On the other hand, the older and more conservative
        Jews who aren't entirely representative of the more liberal body of
        Jewish-American public opinion toward Israel, have a lot of clout with
        national politicians. They express strong desire to vote based on the
        Israel issue and are clustered in Florida and Pennsylvania, large swing
        states in presidential elections. <br /><br />All that said, Pew data
        shows overall consistency in American Jewish views on the US-Israel
        relationship. 54 percent of American Jews think the US supports Israel
        the right amount — and 31 percent say it doesn't go far enough. By
        contrast, 31 percent of white evangelicals think the US has reached the
        right level of support, while 46 percent want the US to support Israel
        more. <br /><br />Add evangelicals, Jews, and broad public support
        together, and you get consistent, bipartisan support for Israel.

      <div class="sub-articles">
        No account of US-Israel relations can ignore the American Israel Public
        Affairs Committee — AIPAC for short. AIPAC is America's largest
        pro-Israel lobby. Surveys of Capitol Hill insiders conducted by Fortune
        (1997) and National Journal (2005) ranked it the second-most powerful
        lobbying shop in Washington, after (respectively) the AARP and National
        Federation of Independent Business. Neither survey is particularly
        statistically rigorous, so don't take the specific rankings too
        seriously. And AIPAC loses on plenty of issues. However, the surveys do
        suggest that AIPAC is perceived as hugely powerful within Washington.
        <br /><br />Saying that AIPAC pushes US foreign policy in a more
        pro-Israel direction isn't controversial. The big, and extremely
        contentious, question is just how much AIPAC actually matters. Is the
        group actually steering US politics and foreign policy in a direction it
        wouldn't go on its own? <br /><br />The major flashpoint here is John
        Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt's The Israel Lobby and American Foreign
        Policy, which began as an 2006 essay and evolved into a book. The two
        eminent international relations scholars argued that there's no way to
        explain the US-Israel relationship, from an IR perspective, other than
        as AIPAC and its allies pushing the US to act counter to its own
        interests. They reject that either strategy or shared values fully
        explain the US support for Israel, so lobbying must. "The unmatched
        power of the Israel Lobby," Walt and Mearsheimer write, is "the"
        explanation for America's continued strong support for Israel.
        <br /><br />This argument is hugely controversial, including among
        international relations theorists. Some argued that The Israel Lobby
        creepily invoked classic anti-Semitic tropes of Jews secretly
        controlling the government. Others dismissed it as, in one particularly
        memorable phrase, "piss-poor, monocausal social science."
        <br /><br />One of the main criticisms of Walt and Mearsheimer's thesis
        is that they don't present very much direct evidence that AIPAC lobbying
        influenced specific votes. Another criticism is that Walt and
        Mearsheimer premise their thesis on the argument that Israel is neither
        strategically nor morally worthy of American support, and so
        policymakers must be supporting Israel because they've been coerced into
        it by AIPAC, whereas a number of policymakers will tell you they
        earnestly believe the alliance is worthwhile absent lobbying. Critics
        also argue that the definition of "Israel Lobby" beyond AIPAC used in
        the book is so large as to encompass basically the entire American
        foreign policy establishment. <br /><br />Whatever you think of this
        debate, it can be easy to get lost in a binary between "the Israel lobby
        is all that matters" and "the Israel lobby is irrelevant." What's
        clearly true is that AIPAC is highly influential, but also that its
        power is linked to the other sources of US support for Israel; it does
        well on whipping up support for bills that are already in line with
        public opinion. <br /><br />AIPAC doesn't always win. For instance, it
        lost a major fight in Congress when it pushed for more sanctions on Iran
        in February 2014; the sanctions were likely designed to kill the ongoing
        US-Iran nuclear negotiations. AIPAC's influence is a product of
        financial resources and power, sure, but also of choosing to push for
        policies that have public support and are consonant with American grand
        strategy in the Middle East. <br /><br />

        It's hard to know where one driver of America's Israel policy ends and
        another begins. For instance: early in his administration, President
        Obama pushed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to halt
        settlement growth in the West Bank; Netanyahu resisted this in part by
        rallying his allies in Congress. Netanyahu's allies in both parties, who
        are always eager to appear pro-Israel, pressured Obama to drop his
        anti-settlements push, which he did. <br /><br />The question here is
        whether, in this case and others, US foreign policy interests or US
        domestic politics was ultimately more consequential to driving the
        US-Israel relationship. For example, would Obama have pushed harder
        against settlements had Netanyahu not been able to call up so many
        allies in Congress? Were those members of Congress primarily driven by
        pure domestic politics, which do favor pro-Israel policies, by an
        earnest concern that Obama's approach was bad for Israelis, or by a
        belief that Obama was hurting US foreign policy interests?
        <br /><br />In thinking about the future of US-Israel relations, it's
        much more helpful to examine what might cause these broad-bush factors
        to change. In simpler terms: is there a scenario under which the US and
        Israel drift apart? <br /><br />Barnett, the George Washington
        University scholar, sees Israel's continued occupation of the West Bank
        as the greatest threat to the relationship. He notes that, in the early
        '90s, Congress made a $10 billion loan guarantee conditional on the fact
        that Israel didn't use any of the money for West Bank settlements.
        Israel's prime minister, Yitzhak Shamir, tried to fight it, but the Bush
        administration stood firm. Shamir lost, both in Congress and with the
        executive, because the Israeli position wasn't consistent with the US
        vision of a Western, democratic Israel. <br /><br />"US-Israeli
        relations," Barnett writes, "are dependent upon Israel's having a
        particular identity." That may even be true among American Jews, as
        journalist Peter Beinart argued in an essay almost as controversial as
        Walt and Mearsheimer's. Beinart argues that Israel's ongoing occupation
        of the West Bank is already alienating younger and more secular Jews,
        and that AIPAC and other mainstream Jewish organizations risk losing
        their broad base of support unless they become more willing to criticize
        Israel on these points. <br /><br />Barnett's conclusion only follows if
        you think "shared values" are the linchpin of US-Israel relations. Maybe
        the US would still think it's strategically useful to support Israel.
        Maybe Israel remains popular among certain Christians and the broader
        public regardless of its Palestinian policy. Maybe AIPAC remains strong
        enough to keep Congress in line. Maybe Israel comes to an agreement with
        the Palestinians and Barnett's point becomes moot. <br /><br />For now,
        though, there's little evidence that American support for Israel is
        fundamentally breaking down — whether you think that's a good or bad
        thing. <br /><br />
