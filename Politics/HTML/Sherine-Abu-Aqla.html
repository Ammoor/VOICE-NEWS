        <div class="sub-articles">
          Abu Akleh was born into a Christian Palestinian family in Jerusalem.
          Her father, Nasri Abu Akleh, was from a Greek Melkite family in nearby
          Bethlehem, while her mother, Louli (née Zakaria) Abu Akleh, belonged
          to a Greek Orthodox family from Jerusalem. Abu Akleh never married,
          but she remained close to her brother, Anton (“Tony”) Abu Akleh, and
          his children, who referred to her as a “second mom.”<br /><br />Born
          four years after East Jerusalem was occupied by Israel in the Six-Day
          War (1967), Abu Akleh belonged to an uncertain generation of
          Jerusalemites. Jordan still claimed sovereignty over East Jerusalem,
          and most of its residents found it more beneficial to retain Jordanian
          passports than to apply for the rights and protections of Israeli
          citizenship. The arrangement of permanent resident status while
          holding Jordanian passports allowed Palestinian Jerusalemites to
          remain connected to their families, and to Palestinian society more
          broadly, without losing their homes or their neighbourhoods. But it
          also made them vulnerable to the possibility that their residency
          could be revoked at any time. They were also left with a limited voice
          in policy making that affected their neighbourhoods.<br /><br />For a
          period of Abu Akleh’s childhood, she lived with relatives in New
          Jersey. She obtained American citizenship and visited the United
          States with some frequency, but she continued to reside in Jerusalem
          in her childhood neighbourhood of Beit Hanina. <br /><br />Abu Akleh
          went to Jordan in 1987 to study architecture at the Jordan University
          of Science and Technology. In December of that year, the first
          Palestinian intifada, or uprising, broke out after years of mounting
          frustration toward Israeli policies. Eager to get the Palestinians’
          story out to the world, Abu Akleh eventually decided to transfer to
          nearby Yarmouk University to study journalism. In a clip broadcast on
          Al Jazeera in the months before her death, she told viewers: “I chose
          journalism to be close to the people. It might not be easy to change
          the reality, but at least I could bring their voice to the world.”

          Career and prominence as “the voice of Palestine”
        </h2>
        <div class="sub-articles">
          After graduating, Abu Akleh worked a brief stint at the United Nations
          Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East
          (UNRWA). The start of her journalistic career coincided with the Oslo
          Accords (1993), a bilateral peace agreement between the government of
          Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) that arranged
          for Palestinian self-governance in exchange for peace. With a
          two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict achieving
          international legitimacy, a new Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation
          was established with international funding in 1994. Through it, a new
          radio station was established called the Voice of Palestine, in which
          Abu Akleh played a foundational role. Her early career also included
          gigs at Amman Satellite Channel and Radio Monte Carlo Moyen-Orient.
          <br /><br />In 1997 Abu Akleh joined Al Jazeera, an Arabic-language
          cable television news network that had been founded one year earlier
          by the Qatari emir. As a field correspondent, she provided an
          international audience with insight directly from inside the
          Israeli-Palestinian conflict. She rose to prominence with the outbreak
          of the second intifada in 2000, as Palestinians and Arabs worldwide
          gathered around their television sets for the latest updates on the
          violence. Abu Akleh’s residency in Jerusalem, moreover, gave her the
          ability to report to the Arab world from within Israel, including
          during the Lebanon War in 2006. Although she often reported in tense
          and dangerous situations, she remained composed, collected, and
          focused on explaining the situation around her in a calm and
          articulate manner. In a reflection of her reputable reporting during
          the intifada, soldiers of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reportedly
          mimicked her over a loudspeaker during the IDF’s 2002 siege of
          Ramallah: “Curfew is declared, Shireen Abu Akleh, Al Jazeera.”
          <br /><br />Apart from her work for Al Jazeera, Abu Akleh helped train
          students in journalism in the West Bank. She worked at Birzeit
          University’s Media Development Center near Ramallah and taught media
          courses at the university. But she also remained cognizant that even
          established journalists must keep up with the ever-transforming
          landscape of their field: in 2020 she completed a program in digital
          journalism at the university.

        <h2 class="titles-of-sub-articles">Death and funeral</h2>
        <div class="sub-articles">
          In early 2022 the West Bank began seeing its worst cycle of violence
          since the second intifada ended in 2005. Abu Akleh was reporting from
          Jenin on May 11 as the IDF was conducting a raid in the town. Despite
          wearing protective gear and a vest that prominently displayed the word
          “PRESS,” she was shot in the head. Israeli officials initially
          indicated that she was caught in the firefight and was killed by a
          Palestinian gunman. But independent investigations corroborated Al
          Jazeera’s claims that she was shot by an IDF soldier and that no
          Palestinian gunmen were in her vicinity. Under international pressure,
          the IDF later backtracked and acknowledged that the bullet that killed
          Abu Akleh likely came from one of its soldiers, but no disciplinary
          actions were taken.
          <br /><br />Abu Akleh’s funeral took place on May 13 in the eastern
          part of Jerusalem. It drew hundreds of mourners bearing Palestinian
          flags and chanting slogans of Palestinian national solidarity. Israeli
          police intervened to prevent the mourners from processing with her
          coffin on foot from a morgue in the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood to the
          Cathedral of the Annunciation in Jerusalem’s Old City, where funeral
          rites were to be held. In the ensuing confrontation, pallbearers
          briefly lost control of the coffin, the lower end of which nearly fell
          to the ground. Abu Akleh was laid to rest later that day in a cemetery
          on Mount Zion, near the burial sites of her father, mother, and
          maternal grandfather.
